PARTING TIPS!
Knowing what's a type and knowing what's a value will take you a long way.

Knowing what can be augmented (interfaces) vs knowing what you have to leave alone when they're defined as types (values).
(once you have a typed value you can't override it b/c that would conflict w/ how js behaves)
